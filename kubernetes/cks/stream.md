# CKS Study Stream

* This stream is not necessarily very interactive. I need to focus on actually studying which means I cannot respond to the chat constantly

* Intention is to show my studying process and how I use the Zettelkasten method and my Second Brain system for studying and productivity

* I will talk when I feel like it and when it will aid the understanding of the material, but actually stuyding and focussing is the main priority.
